### Smarty Template Engine
  
Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic.  
This implies that PHP code is application logic, and is separated from the presentation.  
  
  
  
**The Philosophy**    
The Smarty design was largely driven by these goals:
  
- clean separation of presentation from application code
- PHP backend, Smarty template frontend
- complement PHP, not replace it
- fast development/deployment for programmers and designers
- quick and easy to maintain
- syntax easy to understand, no PHP knowledge required
- flexibility for custom development
- security: insulation from PHP
- free, open source
